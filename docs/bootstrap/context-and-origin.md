# Context And Origin

## Purpose

This document captures the origin story and the already-completed work that led
to the creation of this repository.

It exists so a future session can answer:

- what `helm` already is
- what was already stabilized before extraction
- why a dedicated repository now makes sense
- which architectural framing was accepted before the extraction began

## Origin

`helm` started as the root orchestration skill for engineering work in
the Prop4You ecosystem.

It gradually evolved from a branch classifier into a visible control plane
responsible for:

- classifying trivial vs non-trivial work
- deciding whether prompt hardening is required
- choosing honest issue topology
- opening manager lanes
- deciding staffing shape and delegation budget
- governing bounded-agent optionality
- enforcing risk and proof ordering
- entering root-owned closure mode before `Done`

The maturity threshold was crossed when `helm` began to own not only the
run classification but also:

- agent ontology
- pooling model
- root vs bounded-agent authority boundaries
- issue topology policy
- risk-enforcement matrix
- promotion/parity protocol for runtime mirrors

At that point, treating it as "just another local skill" stopped being a good
fit.

## Why A Dedicated Repository Now Makes Sense

The decision to create this repository was based on the conclusion that
`helm` is better modeled as an opinionated platform than as a local
project artifact.

The most important insight was this:

- the right separation is not `Prop4You` vs `not Prop4You`
- the right separation is `core laws + adapters + profiles + overlays`

That means `helm` can keep a strong opinionated default stack while still
being adaptable to another project through onboarding, adapters, and profiles.

## Bootstrap-Time Upstream Sources

When this repository was created, the most mature source material lived in the
Prop4You workspace.

Primary upstream locations:

```text
/home/marcelo-karval/Backup/Projetos/prop4you/prop4you-inertia/docs/Z.ai-skill-seeds/skills/helm/
/home/marcelo-karval/Backup/Projetos/prop4you/prop4you-inertia/docs/architecture/helm-control-plane.md
/home/marcelo-karval/.Z.ai/skills/helm/
```

Important upstream modules at bootstrap time included:

- root `SKILL.md`
- root `README.md`
- `references/Z.ai-agents/*`
- `references/autoresearch-and-self-evolution.md`
- `references/prompt-hardening-gate.md`
- `references/issue-stack.md`
- `references/subagent-model.md`
- `references/executive-operating-matrix.md`
- `references/current-enforcement-surfaces.md`

## Stabilization Batches Already Completed

The following batches were completed before extraction planning started.

### P4Y-1162

- commit: `cab7399d`
- purpose:
  - formalize the macro operating protocol for `helm`
- result:
  - created the explicit macro-control-plane references for agent governance,
    issue topology, execution contracts, staffing, return contracts, and
    macro replay

### P4Y-1163

- commit: `6da662f2`
- purpose:
  - harden the macro control plane
- result:
  - closure semantics were made root-owned
  - design-contract lane ownership was clarified
  - risk enforcement was consolidated through a matrix model

### P4Y-1164

- commit: `bc19a967`
- purpose:
  - align the sandbox root `SKILL.md` with the new control-plane doctrine
- result:
  - added explicit agent optionality, pools, root-vs-future-agent rule,
    root-owned issue topology, risk enforcement, and root closure mode

### P4Y-1165

- commit: `982baf53`
- purpose:
  - create the sandbox `helm` README
- result:
  - established a living operational guide above the short root skill

### P4Y-1166

- commit: `35a87f08`
- purpose:
  - harden README doctrine
- result:
  - made prompt hardening and issue-driven mutation stack explicit
  - harmonized subagent doctrine with agent optionality
  - removed old public `MULTI-AGENT DEFAULT` drift

### P4Y-1167

- commit: `93cbb475`
- purpose:
  - harmonize remaining summary doctrine
- result:
  - removed remaining mandatory multi-agent wording from summary references
  - aligned public closure wording with root-owned closure mode

### P4Y-1168

- commit: `194eb71f`
- purpose:
  - promote sandbox `helm` into the runtime global mirror
- result:
  - sandbox and `skills/helm/` reached parity
  - `helm-control-plane.md` was aligned with the hardened doctrine

## Accepted Architectural Reframing

The discussion that triggered this new repository produced a clearer framing
for extraction.

`helm` should be modeled as:

- `accelerate-core`
- `workflow-adapters`
- `stack-profiles`
- `runtime-adapters`
- `agent-factory`
- `onboarding`
- `project-overlays`

This is stronger than a narrow "move the skill into another repo" framing.

## Key Accepted Insights

### 1. Workflow backends are adapters

`linear` should not be treated as the only supported workflow backend.

The correct target is:

- same orchestration architecture
- same issue/state/label conventions at the conceptual level
- different operational adapters for systems such as:
  - `linear`
  - `github`
  - future `jira`

### 2. Runtime commands need an adapter layer

The important stable opinion is not the literal command text. The stable truth
is the capability and wrapper discipline.

Example:

- Python execution should think in terms of the project's runtime wrapper
- in the current dominant stack that wrapper is `uv`

### 3. Stack opinions are valid, but should be modeled as profiles

`helm` may be born strongly opinionated for a stack such as:

- Next.js
- App Router
- React
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind

That is not a contradiction with adaptability.

The opinion should live in default stack profiles, not in hardcoded platform
limits.

### 4. Documentation systems are optional adapters

The system may use Docusaurus opinionatedly, but Docusaurus should not be a
mandatory universal dependency of the platform.

### 5. Agent design is part of the platform

The current `Z.ai-agents` module proves that `helm` already thinks about:

- when a future agent makes sense
- what families should exist
- what skill envelopes they should carry
- when a gap should remain only a suggestion

This capability should remain native to the platform.

### 6. Greenfield onboarding is a first-class capability

The platform should be able to land in a nearly empty repository and bootstrap:

- discovery
- A&Q
- executive planning
- recommended adapters
- recommended stack profile
- recommended runtime adapters
- recommended skills

This is not an afterthought. It is part of the product direction.

## What Has Not Happened Yet

The following work has not yet happened inside this new repository:

- no actual extraction of upstream files
- no standalone package layout
- no adapter implementations
- no stack-profile directory structure
- no onboarding engine
- no SDD yet

This repository currently holds planning and transition context only.

## Constraint For The Next Phase

The next phase should not treat the Prop4You source tree as something to mirror
blindly.

The next phase must classify material into:

- core
- adapter
- profile
- overlay

That classification is the bridge from this context document into the SDD.
