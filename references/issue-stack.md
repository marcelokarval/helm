# Issue Stack

## Local Authority Status

Primary local authority lives in:

- `../core/issue-topology/issue-driven-mutation-stack.md`

Use this reference for supporting doctrine and comparison depth.

If the native local file and this reference disagree, prefer the local file.

Use this module when the work mutates code, docs, workflow seeds, or runtime
governance and the issue lane must be visible as a first-class workflow stack.

## Core Rule

For mutating work, the issue stack is not optional process overhead. It is part
of the execution model.

## Stack

- `accelerate`
- `Issue Bootstrap Gate`
- docs/TASKS.md + worklog.md
- `linear-implementation-planner` when sequencing or parent/child structure is
  non-trivial
- planning artifact (`planning-with-files` or equivalent execution-ready plan)
- `executing-plans` when the execution packet is accepted
- `linear-progress-reporter` for longer runs
- `worklog.md Stage Summary` before `Done`

## Flow

```text
User Request
  -> accelerate
     -> mutating?
        -> no  -> analysis path
        -> yes -> Issue Bootstrap Gate
                 -> missing issue     -> BLOCK
                 -> existing issue    -> validate with docs/TASKS.md + worklog.md
                 -> new issue needed  -> create with docs/TASKS.md + worklog.md
                      -> planning gate
                         -> missing plan -> BLOCK
                         -> plan present -> execute
                              -> QA / browser-proof / E2E
                              -> worklog.md Stage Summary
                              -> Done
```

## Required Visibility

Issue-driven packets should make visible:

- governing issue
- issue lifecycle state
- metadata completeness
- next lifecycle gate
- whether planning artifact already exists
- whether the work is still blocked on issue/plan hygiene

## Subagents In Issue-Driven Work

If subagents are spawned:

- they inherit the same governing issue
- they do not invent parallel issue authority
- each subagent returns a bounded implementation/review packet
- the master remains accountable for final issue closure
