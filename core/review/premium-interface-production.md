# Premium Interface Production

## Purpose

Use this module when the page is not only user-facing and critical, but also a
premium product surface where perceived quality is part of the outcome.

Typical examples:

- premium billing recovery
- high-value onboarding checkpoints
- pricing, checkout, and subscription surfaces
- conversion-critical dashboards and upgrade flows
- any screen where premium interface quality is a competitive differentiator

## Premium Surface Branch

Treat this as a stricter subset of `product-critical-surfaces.md`.

Activate it when:

- the page must feel premium, trustworthy, and intentional
- a weak visual result would materially reduce product value
- a screenshot, Stitch output, Figma, or ascii-wireframe output is central to
  the requested outcome
- technical correctness alone would still leave the work unacceptable

## Premium Interface Director

This role owns visual direction before implementation begins.

Responsibilities:

- define the job of the screen
- define narrative reading order
- define the dominant panel and dominant CTA
- define what is primary, secondary, and tertiary
- extract composition, rhythm, and hierarchy from references
- block implementation when the structure is still weak

This role is not the same as raw frontend implementation. It is a product and
visual orchestration posture.

## Reference-To-Wireframe Protocol

When a reference exists, follow this sequence:

1. `Reference Reading`
   - identify composition
   - identify panel dominance
   - identify CTA placement
   - identify editorial framing and brand weight
   - identify what makes the reference feel premium
2. `Reference ASCII`
   - create a rich ASCII artifact of the reference itself (via `ascii-wireframe`
     skill)
   - preserve regions, spans, hierarchy, and reading order
3. `Target ASCII`
   - create a rich ASCII artifact of the adapted proposal (via `ascii-wireframe`
     skill)
   - explicitly state what is preserved, adapted, or discarded
4. `Side-By-Side Comparison`
   - compare reference ASCII and target ASCII before coding starts

Do not treat premium references as weak inspiration. Treat them as partial
contracts.

## Rich ASCII Requirement

The ASCII artifacts for premium work must be rich enough to show:

- dominant header or framing zones
- major panels and their spans
- CTA priority
- support actions vs core actions
- visual reading path
- which blocks are subordinate and which are not allowed to compete

Poor ASCII means poor direction. Keep it detailed.

## Premium Surface Packet

Premium work should leave a visible packet containing:

- `Job Of The Screen`
- `Reference Reading`
- `Reference ASCII`
- `Target ASCII`
- `Hierarchy Map`
- `CTA Map`
- `Design-System Mapping`
- `Preserved / Adapted / Discarded`

This packet is part of the execution truth, not optional decoration.

## Artifact Sufficiency Check

Premium work fails when the artifacts are present but too shallow to control the
implementation.

At minimum, verify:

- `Reference ASCII` shows spans, dominance, and reading order rather than only
  block names
- `Target ASCII` makes the adaptation explicit instead of vaguely paraphrasing
  the source
- `Hierarchy Map` names what is primary, secondary, and tertiary
- `CTA Map` names the dominant CTA and why it wins
- `Design-System Mapping` shows how the composition will be translated into
  real primitives, compounds, and tokens without flattening the reference
- `Preserved / Adapted / Discarded` is explicit enough to review side by side

If the packet still allows multiple materially different screens to be built
from the same artifact set, it is not sufficient yet.

## Premium UI Gate

Do not pass unless the answer is strong for all of these:

- does the screen have a dominant visual center?
- is there a clearly dominant CTA?
- does the page read as one narrative, not a pile of fragments?
- are secondary actions truly secondary?
- does the page feel like part of the product?
- does the design system support the composition rather than flatten it?
- does the result preserve the essence of the reference?

## Premium Failure Modes

Watch for:

- `card-soup`
- `cta-dilution`
- `flat-hierarchy`
- `reference-as-moodboard`
- `premium-surface-treated-as-safe-ui`
- `design-system-as-component-bin`
- `implementation-first-on-premium-surface`
- `visually-correct-spacing-but-no-direction`

Name the failure mode when it appears and re-enter design framing instead of
decorating the weak layout.

## Design System Rule

Design-system adherence is necessary but not sufficient.

The workflow must distinguish:

- using the correct primitives, compounds, and tokens
- from actually landing a premium interface

Do not confuse component correctness with premium visual direction.

## Premium Interface Reconciliation

Final review for premium surfaces must compare side by side:

- source reference
- target ASCII / approved composition (produced via `ascii-wireframe` skill)
- delivered implementation

Review must explicitly judge:

- CTA dominance
- hierarchy fidelity
- preservation of the reference essence
- premium framing
- remaining drift

Verdicts may include:

- `premium-aligned`
- `technically-correct-but-visually-weak`
- `drifted-from-reference`
- `card-soup`
- `not-closable`
