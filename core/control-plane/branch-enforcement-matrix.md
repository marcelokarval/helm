# Branch Enforcement Matrix

## Purpose

This document is the native control-plane matrix for deciding:

- which branch is active
- which skills are mandatory
- which gates are blocking
- which artifacts must exist
- which proof is required before closure

It exists to stop branch behavior from depending on operator memory.

## Reading Rule

Each row defines:

- mandatory skills
- mandatory gates
- expected artifacts
- expected evidence
- typical closure blockers

For any engineering run expected to mutate code, workflow seeds, or living
docs, `Issue Bootstrap Gate` is inherited even when the row is not primarily an
issue-management branch.

That gate is satisfied only when:

- the run is attached to an existing execution-ready issue
- or the run created and revalidated a new governing issue or parent/child
  package before implementation
- or the user explicitly approved a narrow no-issue exception

Creating the issue after implementation already began is workflow failure, not
acceptable cleanup.

For non-trivial issue-driven work, `Post-Issue Planning Gate` is inherited in
addition to `Issue Bootstrap Gate`.

That gate is satisfied only when:

- the governing issue already exists and is execution-ready
- an integrated planning artifact exists after issue bootstrap and before code
  mutation
- the artifact shapes bounded execution order, dependencies, gates, and
  evidence

Starting implementation after issue bootstrap but before this planning artifact
exists is execution drift, not acceptable speed.

## Validation Gate Matrix

Do not treat `bun run lint` as sufficient backend runtime proof.

Use the validation stack by slice class:

- backend schema/runtime slice
  - `bun run lint`
  - `bun run db:push`
- frontend TypeScript/runtime slice
  - `bun run lint`
- full-stack slice
  - both gate sets apply

These commands prove different things:

- `bun run lint`
  - Next.js system/config/runtime checks
- `bun run db:push`
  - schema drift without a pushed migration

If a run closes with only `bun run lint` after backend schema/runtime work, treat that
as a validation failure.

If a frontend-bearing or TS contract-bearing run closes without `bun run lint`,
also treat that as a validation failure.

## Matrix

## Gate Ownership Model

Promote gates into one of these classes:

### Root-Explicit

These gates should stay visible from `helm` itself:

- `Prompt Hardening Gate`
- `Issue Bootstrap Gate`
- `Post-Issue Planning Gate`
- `Truth Ownership Check`
- `Failure Classification Gate`
- `Mandatory vs Optional Language Protocol`
- `Artifact Sufficiency Check`
- `Untrusted Ingress Gate`
- `Secrets & Config Hygiene Check`
- `Concurrency Integrity Check`
- `Containment Policy Check`
- `Component Source Ladder`
- `Real Data Readiness Gate`
- `Sidebar / Public Docs Update Gate`

### Adjacent-Skill-Owned

These gates are branch-critical but are best owned by specialized docs or
skills:

- `Backend Product Contract Protocol`
- `Recovery Surface Isolation Rules`
- `Wireframe Before UI`
- `Visual Contract Extraction`
- `Query Shape Proof`
- `Server Prop Copy Ban`
- `i18n Closure Gate`
- `Componentization Discipline`
- `TS/TSX Boundary Audit`
- `Design-System Fidelity`
- `Product-Critical Closure Protocol`

### Lightweight Inline

These can stay inline in root/control-plane docs:

- `Minimal Create Recovery Protocol`
- `Metadata Rehydration Check`
- `Ready-for-Execution Revalidation`
- `Repo Hygiene / Platform Hygiene`
- `Living Docs Obligation`

## Enforcement Note

Additional adjacent-skill discipline:

- frontend structural work should not omit `frontend-boundary-governance`
  whenever `.ts` vs `.tsx`, view-model ownership, or backend/frontend truth
  boundaries are part of the risk
- backend relational or presenter-heavy work should not omit
  `sql-optimization-patterns` when query shape is plausibly part of correctness
- abuse-sensitive user flows should not omit `anti-abuse-review`
- user-facing runtime-sensitive flows should not omit `product-runtime-review`

When the branch cannot justify the omission of a mandatory skill, treat the run
as under-routed rather than merely imperfect.
