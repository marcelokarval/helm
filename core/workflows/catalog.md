# Workflow Catalog

Use this module when the operator needs the complete named workflow map for the
full `helm` model.

## Rule

Do not treat the workflow set as only branch classification.

The full model contains named workflows that must already exist as explicit
operational lanes now, even before future subagent specialization.

Named workflows are execution lanes, not decorative labels.

When a workflow is activated, its expected packet or proof shape should remain
visible in runtime updates.

> **Note:** The original accelerate platform used Playwright for persistent E2E

## Workflow Output Expectations

Some workflows are especially easy to name but under-run. Do not compress them
to vague `reviewed` or `tested` claims.

- `Forensic-Closure`
  - output should reconcile requested vs implemented, promised vs delivered,
    and docs/TASKS.md task or plan truth vs actual landing.
- `Benchmark-Rerun / Result-Registration`
  - output should name benchmark, objective, rule, target, task, expected
    output, comparison axes, evidence strength, registration artifact, and
    final status decision.
  - if the standard comparative benchmark method is used, raw side-by-side
    outputs should be preserved or referenced; if a lighter synthetic rerun is
    used, the output must say it is weaker evidence.
- `Release-Handoff`
  - output should leave merge-readiness status, operator handoff notes, and
    rollback or follow-up posture when relevant.
- `Parallel-Discovery`
  - output should synthesize the parallel reads into one execution decision,
    not just list independent observations.
- `Governed Multi-Subagent`
  - output should include bounded subagent returns plus a visible master
    integration pass that checks conflicts, overlap, and hidden scope drift.

## Selection Rule

Activate the smallest honest workflow set that still protects correctness.

If a benchmark result is being registered into living docs, pair
`Benchmark-Rerun / Result-Registration` with `Issue-Bootstrap` or explicitly
record the current pre-adapter/no-backend exception. Do not hide doc mutation
behind a read-only benchmark label.

If a run repeatedly activates one of the high-signal workflows above but keeps
failing to leave its expected output shape, that is workflow-governance
evidence, not mere local sloppiness.
